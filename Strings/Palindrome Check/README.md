# Palindrome Check

This function takes in a non-empty string and returns a boolean representing whether the string is a palindrome.
A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. A single-character string is considered palindromic. 

 ### Sample input
```javascript
string = "zz2345abbbba5432zz"
```
 ### Sample output
 ```javascript
true
 ```
 ### Space and Time complexity
 `O(n)` time | `O(1)` space - where n is the length of the input string.
