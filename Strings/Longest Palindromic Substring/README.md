# Longest Palindromic Substring

This function takes in a string and returns its longest palindromic substring.
A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. A single-character string is considered palindromic. 

 ### Sample input
```javascript
string = "zzzzzzz2345abbbba5432zzbbababa"
```
 ### Sample output
 ```javascript
"zz2345abbbba5432zz"
 ```
 ### Space and Time complexity
 `O(n^2)` time | `O(n)` space - where n is the length of the input string.
