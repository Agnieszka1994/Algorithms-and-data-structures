# Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm
 This function takes in two strings and return a boolean representing whether the first string contains the second one using the `Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm`. 

 ### Sample Input
```javascript
string = "aefoaefcdaefcdaed"
substring = "aefcdaed"
```
 ### Sample Output
```javascript
true
```
 ### Space and Time complexity
O(n+m) time | O(m) space - where n is the length of the main string and m is the length of the potential substring.
