# Nth Fibonacci

This function takes in an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
For the purpose of this exercise, the first Fibonacci number is `F0 = 0`; therefore `getNthFib(1)` is equal to `F0`, `getNthFib(2)` is equal to `F1`, etc..

### Sample Input
```javascript
n = 11
```
### Sample Output
```javascript
55
//0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
```
### Space and Time complexity 
`O(n) Time` | `O(1)` Space - where n is the input number.
