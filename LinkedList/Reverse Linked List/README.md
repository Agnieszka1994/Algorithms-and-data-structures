# Reverse Linked List

This function takes in a singly linked list, reverse the list in place and returns its new head.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer value, `next` pointer to the next node in the list or to `nullptr` if it's the tail of the list. 

### Sample input
```javascript
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 //head with value 0
```
### Sample output
```javascript
head = 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 //head with value 5
```
### Space and Time complexity

O(n) time | O(1) space - where "n" is the number of nodes in the Linked List
