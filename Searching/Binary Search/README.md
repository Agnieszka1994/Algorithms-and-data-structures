# Binary Search

This function takes in a sorted array of integers and a target integer, uses the `Binary Search` algorithm to determine whether the target integer is contained in the array and returns its index. If it's not contained, the function returns `-1`. 
### Sample Input
```javascript
array = [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71, 72, 73]
target = 33
```
### Sample Output
```javascript
3 
```
### Space and Time complexity
O(log(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array.
