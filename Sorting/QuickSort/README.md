# Quick Sort

This function takes in an array and returns a sorted version of that array. It uses the Quick sort algorithm to sort the array.

### Sample input
```javascript
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
```
### Sample output
```javascript
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```
### Space and Time complexity

Best: O(nlog(n)) time | O(nlog(n)) space - where n is the length of the input array \
Average: O(nlog(n)) time | O(nlog(n)) space \
Worst: O(n^2) time | O(nlog(n)) space
