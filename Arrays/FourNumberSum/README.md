# Four number sum

This function takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum, and returns a two-dimentional array of all quadruplets that sum up to the target sum. 

If no four numbers sum up to the target sum, the function returns an empty array.

# Sample input

array = [7, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2]
target sum = 16

# Sample output

[[7, 6, 4, -1], [7, 6, 1, 2]]
