# Validate subsequence

This function takes in two arrays of integers and determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that are not necessarily adjacent, but that are in the same order.
A single number and the array itself are both considered valid subsequences of the array. 

### Space and Time complexity

O(n) time | O(1) space  â€” where n is the length of the array.
