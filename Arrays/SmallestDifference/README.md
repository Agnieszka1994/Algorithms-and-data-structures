# Smallest Difference

This function takes in a non-empty array of integers, finds the pair of numbers(one from each array), whose absolute difference is closest to zero, and returns an array containing these two numbers. 

### Space and Time complexity 

O(nlog(n) + mlog(m)) time | O(1) space - where n, m are the lengths of the input arrays.
