# Spiral Traverse

This function takes in a two-dimentional array that can be either rectangle-shaped or square-shaped and returns a one-dimentional array of all the array's elements in spiral order. 

### Sample input
array = [ \
    [1, 2, 3, 4],\
    [12, 13, 14, 5],\
    [11, 16, 15, 6],\
    [10, 9, 8, 7],\
]
### Sample output

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

### Space and Time complexity
O(n) Time | O(n) Space - where n is the total number of elements in the array.
