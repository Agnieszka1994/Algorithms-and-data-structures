# Monotonic array

This function takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic. An array is considered to be monotonic when its elements from left to right are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing. 
Empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic. 

### Space and Time complexity 

O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array.
